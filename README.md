# Cloud-Based-POS-System

  Under Construction 

  Current School Project

We are developing a Cloud-Based POS and Inventory System for a local restaurant in a 6-week school project. Our team utilizes technologies such as Python, JavaScript, AWS, Microsoft Azure, PostgreSQL, and Django. As the project manager, we are improving the order and inventory management in our application while using Agile methodologies and introducing Scrum tools during the application development.
