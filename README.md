# Innovative POS System

## Overview

This project is the result of a semester-long effort in software engineering, focusing on the development of an innovative Point of Sale (POS) system. Our team was tasked with improving the user interface of an existing POS system using a combination of existing tools and technologies.

## Key Features

- **User Roles**: Our system supports multiple user roles, including managers, cashiers, customers, and menu board operators. Each role offers a tailored experience to meet their specific needs within the store environment.

- **Integration with External APIs**: We have integrated three external APIs into our system:
    - **3rd-party Authentication**: Leveraging Google OAuth2 for user authentication.
    - **Translation Service**: Utilizing Google Translate to provide translation capabilities.
    - **Weather Service**: Integrating OpenWeather to provide weather data for enhanced customer experience.

- **Accessibility**: Our project is designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines. We also implemented features to ensure screen reader compatibility.

- **Agile Development**: We followed the Agile software development methodology, conducting user studies and incorporating user feedback into our iterative development process.

- **Deployment**: Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was deployed and updated regularly, ensuring a continuously functional system.

## Live Demo

Our project is demonstrated through a live demo that showcases the following:

- All user interfaces: Customer, Employee (Manager and Cashier), Menu Board, and Administrator.

## Accessibility

Our project follows the four principles of WCAG 2.1 for accessibility: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. It has been thoroughly tested with an Accessibility Checker, ensuring a high level of accessibility compliance.

## Presentation and Final Project Grade

Our final project was presented, demonstrating its evolution from the initial design to the deployed service. We aimed to convince stakeholders of the project's value.

## Team Contribution

Our team worked collaboratively, and each member made significant contributions to the project. We maintained transparency in individual contributions and adhered to the Aggie Honor Code throughout the development process.
